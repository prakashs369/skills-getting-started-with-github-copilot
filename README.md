# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

_Learn to use GitHub Copilot to accelerate your development workflow._

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This exercise will help you get started with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use GitHub Copilot for code completion
- Writing functions with Copilot suggestions
- Using Copilot to implement TODO comments
- Leveraging Copilot for different programming languages

## Prerequisites

- GitHub Copilot enabled in your IDE (VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)
- Basic understanding of Python or JavaScript
- Familiarity with your code editor

## Exercise Files

This repository contains two starter files for practicing with Copilot:

### 1. `calculator.py` - Python Exercise

A simple calculator module with TODO comments. Practice using Copilot to:
- Complete the `multiply()` function
- Implement the `divide()` function with error handling
- Add the `power()` and `square_root()` functions
- Write additional test cases in `main()`

**Try this:**
1. Open `calculator.py` in your editor
2. Place your cursor after a TODO comment
3. Start typing and watch Copilot suggest completions
4. Press `Tab` to accept a suggestion or `Esc` to dismiss

### 2. `members.js` - JavaScript Exercise

A member management module with function stubs. Use Copilot to:
- Implement `findMemberByName()` to search the members array
- Complete `filterMembersByRole()` to filter members
- Write `getAllMemberNames()` to extract names
- Calculate the average age in `getAverageAge()`

**Try this:**
1. Open `members.js` in your editor
2. Position your cursor in an empty function
3. Type a comment describing what you want to do
4. Let Copilot suggest the implementation

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** (if you haven't already)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prakashs369/skills-getting-started-with-github-copilot.git
   cd skills-getting-started-with-github-copilot
   ```

2. **Open in your favorite editor** with Copilot enabled

3. **Start with the Python calculator:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. **Test your JavaScript code:**
   ```bash
   node members.js
   ```

## Tips for Using Copilot

- **Write clear comments**: Copilot works best when you describe what you want in natural language
- **Accept or reject**: Use `Tab` to accept, `Esc` to reject suggestions
- **Iterate**: If the first suggestion isn't perfect, try rephrasing your comment or typing a bit more
- **Review carefully**: Always review Copilot's suggestions to ensure they match your intent
- **Multiple suggestions**: Use `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on Mac) to see alternative suggestions

## Best Practices

1. Write descriptive function names and comments
2. Break complex problems into smaller functions
3. Test the code that Copilot generates
4. Use Copilot as a pair programmer, not a replacement for thinking
5. Learn from the suggestions Copilot provides

## Next Steps

After completing this exercise:
- Explore Copilot Chat for more interactive assistance
- Try using Copilot on your own projects
- Experiment with different types of code (tests, documentation, etc.)
- Learn about Copilot's slash commands and context awareness
